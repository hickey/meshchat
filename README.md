# MeshChat

MeshChat for AREDN (in Lua). MeshChat has become the defacto standard
chat application for AREDN networks. A number of features make it easy
to implement and use:

* Installable on AREDN firmware and most any Linux distribution
* Automatic synchronization between nodes using the same service name
* No account creation necessary--users access using call sign
* Simple user interface

If you are looking for a feature to be implemented or find a bug, please
be sure to [create an issue](https://github.com/hickey/meshchat/issues/new)
in the project so that it can be prioritized.
